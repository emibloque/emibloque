> Hey!

My name is **Luis Emilio**, but feel free to call me _Emi_.

I'm a Software Engineer currently working at [The Cocktail](https://the-cocktail.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I dedicate the major part of my time writing PHP, Ruby, Elixir and JavaScript code.

One of my greatests passions is to play Rink Hockey (in Spanish _Hockey Sobre Patines_) and talk about anything related to it. I also enjoy praticing Karate, surf or snowboarding. I'm a fan of sport in general.

In my free time, I love to cook, take photos and videos, compose music and rap, hang out with my friends, watch series and films or travel and eat awesome food with my girlfriend all around the globe.

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:emibloque@gmail.com) if you want!
