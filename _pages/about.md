> Hey!

My name is **Luis Emilio Velasco SÃ¡nchez**, almost everybody call me _Emi_. I'm a Software Engineer currently working at [The Cocktail](https://the-cocktail.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I dedicate the major part of my time writing PHP, Ruby, Elixir or JavaScript code.

One of my greatests passions is to play Rink Hockey (in Spanish _Hockey Sobre Patines_) and talk about anything related to it. I also enjoy to pratice Karate, surf or snowboarding.

In my free time, I love to travel and eat awesome food with my girlfriend all around the globe.
