> Hey!

My name is **Luis Emilio**, but feel free to call me _Emi_.

I'm an associate professor in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.di.uniovi.es/) at [University of Oviedo](http://www.uniovi.es/).
Also, I work as a software engineer at [The Cocktail](https://the-cocktail.com/){:target="_blank"}, where I dedicate the major part of my time communicating and teaching best practices, while writing some PHP, Ruby, Elixir, JavaScript and TypeScript code.

One of my greatests passions is to play Rink Hockey (in Spanish _Hockey Sobre Patines_) and talk about anything related to it. I also enjoy practicing Karate, surf or snowboarding. I'm a fan of sport in general.

In my free time, I love to cook, take photos and videos, compose music, hang out with my friends, watch series and films, or travel and eat awesome food with my girlfriend all around the globe.

Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:emibloque@gmail.com) if you want!
